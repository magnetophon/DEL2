#+title: Todo


* make offset smaller
* make modulation a curve param, with view like vital?
* make modulation a curve editor?
* increase meter range, add pre-delay low cut
* maybe add dry/wet for filters
* make attack and release continuously update
* increase minimal attack and release
* offset/amount  -> amount/offset
* simd smoother, for up to 8 smoothers at once!
* README: add chorus trick and gated delay example
* make everything smaller, just scale down
* reset button (for expert mode separately?)
* downgrade macos (& ubuntu?)
* friendly welcome text on first open
* make easy/expert a normal slider
* resize window on easy/expert change, so that button stays in the same place
* note> pan:  make it a range and adjust zoom range to it?
* make loop trigger
* make bpm sync the default (maybe check (at init?if tempo available)

# TODO: test!
* smarter s2v seconds: if s < max seconds: interpret as seconds else as ms     or just always as sec?
* make attack and release Exponential?
* see which param needs an Arc and why
* why don't the notes smooth when switching presets?
* put back gui smoother per note?
** when there is a new tap while the previous one isn't done smoothing, we get glitches
** when we load new presets too
* default preset:
** should be the state of parameters struct contained in the Default instance of your plugin
