**** but doesn't work in bitwig
** factory presets:

*** https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_dev_portal/pages/Technical+Documentation/Presets+Program+Lists/Index.html
** make loop trigger
*** one trigger to signify the end of the loop and start looping
*** one trigger to toggle between loop and live
** resize window on easy/expert change, so that button stays in the same place
  works, but with glitches: https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug/issues/127#issuecomment-2555783459
* sometime
** simd smoother, for up to 8 smoothers at once!
** make modulation a curve param, with view like vital?
** make modulation a curve editor?
** see which param needs an Arc/Atomic and why
*** the gui smooth temp vals need an atomic cause the delaygraph draw fn doesn't have access to anything mutable
** why don't the notes smooth when switching presets?
*** put back gui smoother per note?
**** when there is a new tap while the previous one isn't done smoothing, we get glitches
**** when we load new presets too
** don't create a new smoother on every new tap?
** show (& change) mod amount in main knob
* maybe?
** zoom notes only after time-out?
** friendly welcome text on first open
** make easy/expert a normal slider
** add dry/wet for filters
** make everything smaller, just scale down
** reset button (for expert mode separately?)
** keep glow on hover action that is in skia branch?
*** maybe put it everywhere?
*** otoh: this differentiates the triggers from the knobs
