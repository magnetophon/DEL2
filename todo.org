#+title: Todo


* make offset smaller
* make modulation a curve param, with view like vital?
* make modulation a curve editor?
* increase meter range, add pre-delay low cut
* maybe add dry/wet for filters
* make attack and release continuously update
* increase minimal attack and release
* offset/amount  -> amount/offset
* simd smoother, for up to 8 smoothers at once!
* README: add chorus trick and gated delay example
* make everything smaller, just scale down
* reset button (for expert mode separately?)
* downgrade macos (& ubuntu?)
* friendly welcome text on first open
* make easy/expert a normal slider
* resize window on easy/expert change, so that button stays in the same place
* note> pan:  make it a range and adjust zoom range to it?
* make loop trigger
* make bpm sync the default (maybe check (at init?if tempo available)
* don't create a new smoother on every new tap?
* smarter s2v seconds: if s < max seconds: interpret as seconds else as ms     or just always as sec?
* make attack and release Exponential?
* see which param needs an Arc and why
* why don't the notes smooth when switching presets?
* put back gui smoother per note?
** when there is a new tap while the previous one isn't done smoothing, we get glitches
** when we load new presets too
* default preset:
** should be the state of parameters struct contained in the Default instance of your plugin

*** but doesn't work in bitwig

* position action labels
* slider psitions: offset & note>pan down a bit, type & cutoff up a bit
* keep glow on hover action?
** maybe put it everywhere?
** otoh: this differentiates the triggers from the knobs


* layout
easy mode:
| easy/expert   |           |   | FILTERS       | MODULATION                      |
| direct/toggle | dry/wet   |   | filter type   | cutoff mod type (velocity/note) |
| TRIGGERS      |           |   | cutoff/octave | cutoff mod amount/transpose     |
| mute in       | mute out  |   | resonance     | res mod amount                  |
| clear taps    | lock taps |   | drive         | drive mod amount                |

dry/wet direct/toggle       || type (lp/bp/hp) / cutoff mod (velocity/note)
triggers                    ||         "low vel / high vel" -> "main /  modulation"

global drive is not needed with main/modulation
