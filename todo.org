#+title: Todo
* INBOX


* today
** smarter s2v hz:  1k is 1000
** HQ mode: stereo simd, LQ mode: 4 chan simd
*** check HP filters in LQ mode, maybe switch to LP only for now?
*** fix cutoff in LQ mode
*** and (reverse) shelving eq cf
** keep DSP params till tap is inaudible

* soon
** downgrade macos (& ubuntu?)
** use https://build.opensuse.org/
** make attack and release continuously update
** better interpolation panner delay
*** use separate crate for panner delay?
*** put back block-wise copy of main delay
** increase gain opposite chan when panning?
** make attack and release Exponential?
*** done in skia branch, TODO: test
** smooth all dsp params (at the end of the interpolation?)

** README: add chorus trick and gated delay example
** default preset:
*** should be the state of parameters struct contained in the Default instance of your plugin

**** but doesn't work in bitwig
** factory presets:
*** https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_dev_portal/pages/Technical+Documentation/Locations+Format/Preset+Locations.html
*** https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_dev_portal/pages/Technical+Documentation/Presets+Program+Lists/Index.html
** make loop trigger
*** one trigger to signify the end of the loop and start looping
*** one trigger to toggle between loop and live
** screenshot in readme
** demo video
*** with Mark on trumpet and Bernd on drum trigger
** resize window on easy/expert change, so that button stays in the same place
  works, but with glitches: https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug/issues/127#issuecomment-2555783459
** oversampling?
** choke filter:  add DC offset to the input
* sometime
** other way to change the delay time: https://signalsmith-audio.co.uk/writing/2021/stride-interpolated-delay/
** crossfade highshelf to bypass when gain is low
** simd smoother, for up to 8 smoothers at once!
** make modulation a curve param, with view like vital?
** make modulation a curve editor?
** see which param needs an Arc/Atomic and why
*** the gui smooth temp vals need an atomic cause the delaygraph draw fn doesn't have access to anything mutable
** why don't the notes smooth when switching presets?
*** put back gui smoother per note?
**** when there is a new tap while the previous one isn't done smoothing, we get glitches
**** when we load new presets too
** don't create a new smoother on every new tap?
** show (& change) mod amount in main knob
* maybe?
** research choke event, possibly clear_taps()
** make mutes sample-accurate
** optional: live-mode / daw-mode switch
*** compensate for host latency by adjusting the delay read index
** zoom notes only after time-out?
** friendly welcome text on first open
** make easy/expert a normal slider
** add dry/wet for filters
** make everything smaller, just scale down
** reset button (for expert mode separately?)
** keep glow on hover action that is in skia branch?
*** maybe put it everywhere?
*** otoh: this differentiates the triggers from the knobs
